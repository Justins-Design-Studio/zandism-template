          <p class="introParagraph">Zandism has been painting pictures for over twenty years now.</p>

    

          <p>He employs a wide range of techniques and an eclectic range of sources drawing from Pop Art, Graphic Novels and Graffiti Art.</p>

    

          <p>His iconography is most influenced by the urban protest element of Graffiti.</p>

    

          <p>Using a vivid hot and cold palette original harmonies are produced through chromatic extremes. His intention has been to combine the anarchic skills of a graffiti artist with the discipline of a studio painter.</p>

    

          <p>His images offer the onlooker a glimpse into other worlds: juggling the real, the surreal, the hyper real. This notion of escapism permeates his images throughout.</p>

    

          <p>Other artists have used the images from mid twentieth century comics, scaling them up, often to objectify them, draining them of seriousness and mystery.</p>

          <p>Zandism uses a similar scale and boldness but plays with the emotional content of the image.</p>
